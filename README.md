# pump_control_v2
State machine based pump control system that uses Arduino internal registers to generate interrupts and change the state of the system. 
The state machine will control the pump , direction, speed, and duration.

The Virtuino HID is the control system for manual operation.

HW switches can be used to initiate pump function as well.
